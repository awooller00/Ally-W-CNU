## **Summary**
_Southern Mosaic_ created by Adiya Jain is an interactive timeline of the travels of John and Ruby Lomax through the states of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, and South Carolina. The Lomax’s used a phonograph to capture folk songs along their trip to document the word-of-mouth tradition before radio and record players made this art obsolete. Adiya Jain’s project analyzes the recordings and field notes from the Lomax’s travels with the historical context necessary to understand these traditional music with particularities of the era and each region, religion, ethnicity.

## **Organization**
The project site is a single page that can be scrolled through with headers dividing up where the information about each different state starts. While this page is a simple user interface, the single page of scrolling makes it hard to reach information about specific states quickly. A dropdown menu with a short description of each state would make the layout much more accessible for users.

## **Photos**
Throughout the project there are corresponding photos of the noted folk singers in portrait and candid formats. These photos break up the text and data visualizations by showing the lives of those who contributed to the archive of folk songs that the Lomax’s gathered. 

Each photo is also captioned to give context about who is in the photo or what action is happening.

## **Maps**
Aditya Jain uses a map graphic that tracks the Lomax’s three month trip over ten different states. Each star marks a stop and shows a small quip about what happened while the couple was in this spot. After clicking the “start your journey” there is no way to stop the graphic until it is finished. A problem arises when the text boxes start disappearing before a reader has time to completely process the information presented. 

This function is fixable by allowing the graphic to be paused for ease of reading. Instead the descriptions fly through the screen at a rate that cannot be read. 

The concept was a great idea that gives an interesting visualization of the Lomax’s route. In the end it is something that a reader will quickly skip over before the graphic is even finished due to lack of comprehension.

## **Text**
The bulk of the context in this project is provided through interactive text boxes. Each state highlights background information by sharing anecdotes about some of the folk songs and who was singing them. The boxes are well spaced and written in white boxes so that they stand out against the dark background.

An interactive feature of these boxes allows readers to listen to the audio that the project is discussing. Unfortunately, the audio playback does not work on mobile devices. On desktops Jain made the decision to allow the songs to play and pause giving the reader control over how much time they want to spend on the different song samples. 

## **Data Visualization**
Each state’s section has an interactive graphic containing extensive data on all the state’s folk history. Guiding lines move through 3 rings. The inner ring shows regions in the state, the middle ring lists specific singers, then the outer ring contains the songs themselves. Each part of this graphic activates by hovering over the spots to highlight the trails, as well as clicking the spots for more information. Upon clicking, details about the recordings and those who sang in them are given that were not integrated into the narrative text boxes.

The key gives the genre breakdown with color coordination. Jain notes that different patterns correlate to different ethnicities and occupations, but fails to mention the specific relationship. This requires the user to click on the dots and assume which information connects with that pattern based on deductive reasoning alone.

The information in the graphic is detailed from broad to specific as it moves outward. The region dots do not provide extra information besides highlighting the grouping of singers from that area. The most effective way to gain information is by clicking on the singer’s dot and looking through the list of songs attributed to them. The design seems to make the song dots obsolete because once the cursor no longer hovers over the artist the line gets intertwined with other threads and cannot be followed to the proper tier. 

## **Music**

The project as a whole describes the interesting history of the types of songs and stories that were shared across so many cultural lines. 
The most popular categories that songs were divided into were:
* Children’s songs
* Work songs
* Ballads
* Fiddle tunes
* Religious songs
* Nursery rhymes

The regularity of each different genre varied based on the state as well as how many people they were able to get in contact with in each area. The project goes into detail about who they collected songs from, such as incarcerated people of color, working men (specifically railroad workers), adults who were taught lullabies as children by their parents or nannies, and so many more. 

These songs are a piece of history that can be studied to understand how people grew up and the changes in our society’s culture and norms. The collection provides a look inside the personal lives of so many types of people. Aditya Jain’s project provides an informative and interactive way to learn about the Lomax’s journey as well as the lives of those they encountered all in one site. She presented the facts in an interesting way that combines visual and auditory senses to immerse the audience in the historical storyline.

The end of the site has a note from Jain that says, “Build with love, by a nonimmigrant, for a beautiful people.” Under her note was a “Thanks” attributed to Library of Congress Labs, The American Folklife Center, Rachel I. Howard, Christa Maher, Nirja Desai, Tahir Hemphill.
