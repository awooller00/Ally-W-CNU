### The definition of Digital Humanities

At the start of this course I didn’t have a pre-existing definition of digital humanities or any idea of what it could entail. The humanities is a study of culture through literature, history, and philosophy. Over time in the class I learned that digital humanities didn’t just mean that the humanities are just put online. Digital Humanities takes what has been learned from the original studying of human culture and analyzes it on a new platform. It creates more accessibility for the general public to understand the nuances of culture with more interactive features to immerse the viewer in the history. 

The new perspectives brought into the humanities introduces modern relevance to the information that has been presented to the public. The field is open to all types of people and anyone can be a digital humanist because each person experiences the world in their own way. These experiences inform how we see and interact with people who are a part of other cultures and philosophies of life. Because of this there are so many ways to interpret the humanistic studies that have been conducted in the past and those who analyze it now can provide ideas on how we should move forward based on how the norms and values change in our society. 

### Projects in the course

I enjoyed reviewing the different projects that are out there. I looked into two different projects. One about folk songs from the south, their origin and recordings from generations who passed them down. Adiya Jain’s project analyzed the recordings and field notes from the travels of the Lomax’s who collected this information within the historical context necessary to understand these traditional music and particularities of the era and each region, religion, ethnicity. This review introduced me to how projects can be set up with a mixture of audio, video, photo, interactive graphics and text in a balanced way so that the viewer can get the most out of the information.

Another project I reviewed was done by a college group at Ohio State about the Latinos who lived in that area, their experiences with migration and how they have intertwined their culture while serving in their communities in activism, education, policy making, faith, and culture based celebrations. This project informed my final grant proposal with my group and helped us bring it to life.

My group and I wanted to enhance the narratives about rich traditions in Latinx culture and the different nations that contribute to the diversity in America through a mapping platform, ArcGIS, and personal narratives. Much of the pre-existing digital humanities projects about Latin culture pertain to the discrimination and hardships they have faced when migrating to the US. We wanted to refocus that perspective and pair oral narratives of US Latinx citizens with their country of origin to highlight what communities within the US have an abundance of that country’s influence. This would encourage a more positive outlook on the contributions of the diverse people we have in our country. 

Although this was only a fictional proposal, our group really loved working on the logistics of it and wished we could have created the project ourselves. We could not make this a reality because of the time and money constraints however we were able to make our own project about CNU and our experience on campus.

The CNU project was a practical way to show that anyone can create a digital humanities project and it doesn’t have to be complicated. My project walked through my freshman year experience of being sent home halfway through second semester because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

I highlighted the top memories I have from freshman year and shared the big moments leading up to right before we got sent home. The connection to the humanities was through everyone’s shared experience with the pandemic. Most people can relate to feeling lost and confused during this time, almost like we were living in an alternate reality. By sharing my experience with finding hope during a time that felt so hopeless it provides an opportunity for others to feel less alone in their experiences. 

When creating the map itself the logistics of ThingLink were a little hard to get used to at first. The software in the digital humanities does take some training and practice, but as someone who has never coded anything before or used a mapping software, I was able to pick up the basics quickly. The simplicity of these softwares shows that anyone can throw themselves into the ring with digital humanities and be successful. As long as they have a life experience to share and thought provoking ideas to impart the field is ready for more people to enter.

### How I have changed

I have always been a very wordy writer. I love big words with strong meaning. Thanks to this course I have learned how to still use my large vocabulary while being concise. I have learned how to separate my writing in a way that keeps the reader's attention. The best tips I have learned are to keep paragraphs short for easy reading, be professional while also making personal connections that others can relate to, and be more concise while varying sentence length so that the readers don’t get bored and lose out on the unique perspective I as the writer have to offer.

Overall this course has offered me so many new ways to analyze, understand, and present the humanities in a new way. I came in knowing nothing, but my expectations for what it could entail were exceeded beyond measure. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone in any field. Our world revolves around understanding people and how they interact within our culture and norms. Working with others is most positively impacted by a better understanding of people’s shared and unique experiences, so every major and every job can be improved by a new generation of people who have contributed and learned about digital humanities.
