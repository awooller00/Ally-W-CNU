## My ThingLink Story

### What's the Map about?

For my ThingLink project I created an interactive map that shared the most memorable moments in my freshman year. When I got to CNU in the fall of 2019 I was so excited to be a new college student and documented everything I did in my Snapchat Memories. Since I had easy access to all this information I knew right away this is what I wanted to talk about in my blog. 

Not only did I document my freshman year but also my experience with being sent home due to COVID-19 about half way through the spring semester of 2020. At the time no one could have imagined the magnitude of this disease and its effects on our country and life as we knew it. 

When making my ThinkLink I wanted to show the progression throughout the semester of my time at CNU which is why I chose to use the numbers 1-10. These numbers show the memories that stood out to me my freshman year pre-covid and lead up to the last days at CNU before being sent home. I loved looking back on the things I got to experience from target runs to the Captains Ball. I tend to look at my freshman year through rose-colored glasses and reminisce about how chaotic and exciting being away from home felt. Now that I’m an upperclassman it feels like the chaos and excitement has died down as my workload has increased and looking back on my memories it reminds me that I still have that spirit now if I chose to let loose every once and a while. 

I made my last two campus memories red exclamation marks to show their importance. These spots demonstrate how little we really knew about what was about to happen. The first one is me walking with my fish to my last class before leaving for spring break. The second one is a few days after getting back from spring break and depicts me _thanking_ COVID for sending us home. Looking back now, that picture makes me laugh because it feels like such a naive statement. We were told it would be a two week extra break and then we’d be back. As we all know this became a year long hiatus from everything familiar. 

On the top of my map I put tags that show what I did while we were under quarantine lockdown. I really allowed myself to find unique ways to fill my time that weren’t just watching tv or being on my phone. I spent time with my family and got creative making a mural on my wall and painting canvas’ for my mom and even some of her friends. Although the effects of COVID-19 on the world were devastating, I believe I chose to spend my time inside becoming a better version of myself and came out the other side with a new perspective on everything I thought I knew.

### Making the map

When creating the map itself the logistics of ThingLink were a little hard to get used to at first. Since all my media was from snapchat, the photos were really tall and skinny so ThingLink kept cropping them weird. I quickly realized that they didn’t have an option to change the crop on the photos and move them on the page which was frustrating. Instead I had to change the dimensions on my own before uploading. I also was able to screenshot some of my photos and for some reason that action made ThingLink display the entire picture. 

This discovery didn’t change everything because my videos couldn’t be resized but they had some text on them that I wanted to display. I noticed that when I squeezed my browser screen and made it less wide, the tags would display, but in full screen it would cut off my videos. All of this could have easily been solved if there was a customizable crop feature in ThingLink that would let me move the photos and videos into the space how I wanted them. 

Overall, I really enjoyed this project and sharing my freshman experience and the things that made me love CNU from the minute I stepped onto campus. Being sent home was unexpected in so many ways, but I chose to use that time to find joy when there was a lot of sadness surrounding the world and that is what I love about my ThingLink story.
