My name is Ally Wooller and I am majoring in Business Marketing with a minor in Leadership Studies at Christopher Newport University (CNU). Deciding on this path came with a lot of trial and error. My first major of choice was political science on the pre-law track, but the idea of law school was too daunting for my taste. I jumped to psychology because I thought helping people emotionally was my calling, yet again the idea of extra schooling after 4 years was my deterrent.

One day I waltzed into the Residence Hall Association (RHA) club meeting, joined the marketing committee, and fell in love! RHA combined my passion for writing, my artistic nature, and analytical thinking all into one place. I immediately switched into pre-business courses and set myself on the track for admittance into the Luter School of Business. 

Since joining RHA I have become the Director of Marketing and worked on advertising projects for our events and proposals, as well as regional and national conferences with other RHAâ€™s around the country. I run our social media such as instagram, twitter, facebook, and tik tok.
