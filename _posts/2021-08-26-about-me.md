My name is Ally Wooller and I am majoring in Business Marketing with a minor in Leadership Studies at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu/) (CNU). Deciding on this path came with a lot of trial and error. My first major of choice was political science on the pre-law track, but the idea of law school was too daunting for my taste. I jumped to psychology because I thought helping people emotionally was my calling, yet again the idea of extra schooling after 4 years was my deterrent.

One day I waltzed into the [Residence Hall Association](https://www.instagram.com/cnu_rha/) (RHA) club meeting, joined the marketing committee, and fell in love! RHA combined my passion for writing, my artistic nature, and analytical thinking all into one place. I immediately switched into pre-business courses and set myself on the track for admittance into the [Luter School of Business](https://cnu.edu/academics/departments/business/). 

Since joining RHA I have become the Director of Marketing and worked on advertising projects for our events and proposals, as well as regional and national conferences with other RHA’s around the country. I run our social media such as instagram, twitter, facebook, and tik tok.

## **Integrating DH into future jobs**
Networking over the internet has become a very important part of business practices. An application of digital humanities (DH) that I hope to bring into my future job positions is creating a section of marketing departments where the humanities collide with a company’s mission statement for their products or services.  

I chose marketing because it requires a combination of creative thinking and analytical skills that catch people’s attention. DH can enhance this approach by adding moving parts to company initiatives, so that the consumer feels well informed about things like sustainability and inclusion efforts. 

## **Flowing between professional and social**
In my life the professional and personal aspects collide most frequently when it comes to leadership positions. Since I was in middle school I have been a mentor to kids younger than me and have been practicing leadership qualities before I took a single course at CNU about it. 
Important qualities in my leadership include:
* Transparency 
* Confidence
* Humility 
* Open mindedness
* Ability to teach others 
Leadership to me has always been about showing others that they too can be great leaders **and** followers through actions instead of words.

I have worked as a camp counselor for middle school and high school sleepaway camps with my church for the past four summers now and the most satisfaction comes from watching students build a community of people who become their support system while I facilitate conversations about their futures and how to navigate personal and professional relationships in their daily lives. 

When I am not working I still spend my time being creative with art and also hanging out with my friends and family.

During quarantine in March of 2020 I was able to paint a small mural on my bedroom wall as a creative outlet.

I also used my time to spread encouragement on instagram. I created a spotlight story about the positivity I was finding through my relationship with Jesus Christ in the midst of all of the turmoil our country was experiencing. My goal was to spread hope in a time when many felt hopeless and create a space for productive conversations among people I may or may not be as close with through a public platform.  

The rest of my free time is spent mainly around my best friends Angie, Erin, Jill, Mariah, Landon, and Immanuel with a constant flow of coffee, music, and thrift shopping anywhere and everywhere.
